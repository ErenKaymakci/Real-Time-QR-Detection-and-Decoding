## What is QR Code
Quick response(QR) code is 10x faster than barcodes. In history, companies used barcodes for keep track of their stocks. But barcodes only store up to 20 alphanumeric characters. So QR codes invented by Japanese company Denzo Wave in 1994. QR codes can store up to 4296 alphanumeric characters.

## How QR Works
We can basically define QR code like 2D arrays. QR codes range from 11x11(called micro QR) pixels up to 177x177. White pixels represents 0, black pixels represents 1. 

The image in the below shows the constant areas in QR code:
